Team EPOS Project
===============================
We, as a team, have created an EPOS that has many features we feel the end user would
find to be very important. These features include adding new items to the database, 
the ability to check, update and delete items from the database and finally the 
ability to get a list of all current customers of the business from the customer
database table. Each of these features can be accessed by following the instructions
below.

Instructions On Use
--------------------------
* In order to run the program and access all of its features, you must run the Main
class and follow the instructions on the command line to use the features.
